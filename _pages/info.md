## Other Info

### AI Engine Introduction

AI Engines are an array of very-long instruction word (VLIW) processors with single instruction multiple data (SIMD) vector units that are highly optimized for compute-intensive applications.

- An AI Engine kernel is a C/C++ program which is written using **native C/C++ language, AI Engine API and specialized intrinsic functions** that target the VLIW scalar and vector processors. 

- The AI Engine kernel code is compiled using the **AI Engine compiler (aiecompiler) that is included in the Vitisâ„¢ core development kit**. The AI Engine compiler compiles the kernels to produce ELF files that are run on the AI Engine processors.

- AI Engine supports **specialized data types and API functions for vector programming**. By restructuring the scalar application code with these API functions and vector data types as needed, you can implement the vectorized application code. 

- The AI Engine compiler takes care of mapping API functions to **operations, vector or scalar register allocation and data movement, automatic scheduling, and generation of microcode** that is efficiently packed in VLIW instructions.
